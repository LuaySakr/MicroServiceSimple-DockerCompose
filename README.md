# MicroServiceSimple-DockerCompose
This project is to be a start point to solve one of the most famous problems last 2 years which is
# Connected Vehicle Platform also it is a way to prove that Microservices is simple to do.
# The Problem :
Vehicles are transforming from individual, self-contained, transportation-focused objects to sophisticated, Internet-connected endpoints, often capable of two-way communication. The new data streams generated by modern connected vehicles drive innovative business models such as usage-based insurance, enable new in-vehicle experiences, and build the foundation for advances in vehicle technology such as autonomous driving and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication.

#### OK, The problem is not a simple one and from an Agile mindset perspective we can start by the simple one in order to make it more complicated
we will start by creating an application to manage vehicle storage and their owners and monitor its status of it connected the platform or not.

we going to create it using microservice architecture as it will help us into multiple points
#### data persistence
#### technology heterogeneous
#### teams distribution
#### integrity
#### scalability
#### containerization
#### independence
#### traceability

in this high-level diagram, we are designing the platform to two types of users on of them is the monitoring user and the other one is the creator himself, to help him to trace the microservice requests and improve his design.
we have dashboard service to the monitoring user to use it as web and responsive application, from this dashboard he can add and delete some customers, vehicle, and vehicle owners to assign vehicle to a customer the next services are the customer, vehicle and vehicle owner services. Each one has its own data storage which is a mongo database so far, 
they are very basic and normal node js services as well as dashboard,
also we have puls worker, it is node js API to act as gateway between vehicles and the system, vehicle should send its signals to puls worker service and we should rename it to match this job however it is currents act as application gateway AND vehicles itself, as we doesnot have vehicles with signal so far.
this service recurring send to vehicle owner service runtime update about vehicle status to check the system functionality

finally, we have Zipkin as the tracer, all services we have send each and every request to Zipkin to log it and let us trace the service's communications

each service has its own repository on GitHub and this repository only for the docker-compose file
it has up.sh script that cloning the rest of services from GitHub and run docker-compose up --build to make the system up and running 

so 
# How To Start?
simply clone this repo and run 

sh up.sh 


# If you need to run the current version without cloning latest repositories
docker-compose up --build



# Test 
each service included in this project has its own unit test cases and you can run it using
npm install
npm test
also, each dockerfile has its own npm test step to help in CI/CD activity 


# Install
if you want to run specific service as stand-alone service without docker-compose file

npm install 
npm start

# CI/CD
we are using Jenkins as CI/CD tool over AWS and its configuration is already on repositories in Jenkinsfile and Jenkins just call it to maintain CI/CD scripts using GitHub

so far it is pipeline job to run docker build to make sure the repository has no coding issue using npm install step and no business valuations using npm test step


regarding docker-compose repository it also has its own Jenkinsfile to run Groovy pipeline script to do up.sh activities

Enjoy :)
