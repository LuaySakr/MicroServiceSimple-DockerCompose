# MicroServiceSimple-DockerCompose
This project is for be a start point to solve one of the most famous problems last 2 years which is
# Connected Vehicle Platform 
also it is a way to prove that Microservices is simple to do.
# The Problem :
Vehicles are transforming from individual, self-contained, transportation-focused objects to sophisticated, Internet-connected endpoints, often capable of two-way communication. The new data streams generated by modern connected vehicles drive innovative business models such as usage-based insurance, enable new in-vehicle experiences, and build the foundation for advances in vehicle technology such as autonomous driving and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication.

#### OK,The problem is not simple one and from Agile mindset perspective we can start by the simple one in order to make it more complicated
we will start by creating an application to manage vehicle storage and their owners and monitor its status of it connected the platform or not.

we going to create it using microservice architecture as it will help us into multiple points
#### data persistence
#### technology heterogeneous
#### teams distribution
#### integrity
#### scalability
#### containerization
#### independence
#### traceability
