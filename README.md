# The Problem :
Vehicles are transforming from individual, self-contained, transportation-focused objects to sophisticated, Internet-connected endpoints, often capable of two-way communication. The new data streams generated by modern connected vehicles drive innovative business models such as usage-based insurance, enable new in-vehicle experiences, and build the foundation for advances in vehicle technology such as autonomous driving and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication.
